Coursework 3
Wrote a program that manages a small library of books. As a user, you can borrow and return books. As a librarian, you can oversee the whole collection of books.


The provided code is a modular C application split across multiple source code and header files, with a corresponding Makefile for compilation on Linux. The application is intended to manage book data, and the Makefile creates an executable in a 'bin' sub-folder.

Key points about the provided code:

Modular Structure:

The code is organized in a modular structure, distributed across multiple source code (.c) and header (.h) files.
Compilation:

The Makefile is provided to compile the entire application on Linux. The command 'make' in the source code folder triggers the compilation process.
Cross-Platform Considerations:

The code is designed for Linux, but the instructions suggest adapting it for other platforms or development environments (IDEs). Users are encouraged to create a single executable application regardless of the platform used.
Executable Output:

Upon successful compilation, the executable is generated in the 'bin' sub-folder.
Initial Functionality:

When executed, the code currently prints simple messages but lacks real functionality.
Code Extension:

Additional functions can be added to enhance the code. The user is encouraged to consider where to add these functions and how they interact with the existing codebase.
Book Data:

The 'bin' sub-folder contains a plain text file of book data.
Project Interactions:

Users can run the code and observe its behavior. The suggestion is to carefully plan and add any necessary functions, considering how they integrate into the overall code structure.
Overall, the provided skeleton code serves as a foundation for a book management application. Users are expected to extend the functionality by adding functions where needed, and the Makefile simplifies the compilation process on Linux.

It complies with gcc on Linux and Windows.
