Wrote a program to play the game of Noughts and Crosses.

The provided C program, consisting of "tic.c" and "tic.h," is designed to implement a Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) game with customizable parameters such as grid size and winning line length. The program skeleton has no useful functionality initially, and additional code needs to be added to achieve the following features:

Displaying the Game Grid:

Given the game parameters (grid size and win length), the program should display the game grid in a defined format. The format is specified on the test data sheet.
Player Turns:

The program should allow two players to take turns adding their symbols (X or O) to the game board.
Determining Game Outcome:

The program needs to determine if one player has won the game or if it's a draw. A win can occur with a line of symbols (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal arrangement.
Optional Game Replay:

After the game is complete, the program can optionally replay the game for the players to view.
Replay or Quit:

Players have the option to either replay the previous game or quit the program.
Empty Functions:

The provided code includes empty functions in "tic.c" and prototypes in "tic.h" with defined comments indicating their purpose. The task is to provide the code implementation for these functions without altering their inputs or outputs.
Additional Functions:

The program allows the addition of any further functions that may be required to complete the code.
Overall, the goal is to create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can interactively play, the game outcome is determined accurately, and an optional replay feature is available for review. The code should adhere to the specified requirements and structure provided in the skeleton files.


It complies with gcc on Linux and Windows.
